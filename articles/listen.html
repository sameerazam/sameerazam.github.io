            <h2 style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br /><span style="color: #3d85c6;">Capitalism</span></h2>
            <p>It’s been long since I’m writing blogs. I choose topics
                based on social need. This topic; “<span style="color: #6aa84f;">Listen to Understand</span>” has deeper impact on
                me. It is based on a documentary published by BBC’s Instagram
                handle, praising Kevin Briggs, a California Highway Patrol Officer, who saved
                lives of many who wanted to give up their life. I liked that documentary very much
                and wanted to write about it. So here it is:</p><p><span style="color: #e06666;">Kevin Briggs</span>, An Officer in California Highway Patrol who was in charge of the area surrounding Golden Gate Bridge. Golden Gate Bridge is an Iconic structure known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean but unfortunately it is also known for being a Suicide Point. Since its opening, more than 1600 people gave up their life from the Golden Gate Bridge.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Kevin Briggs illustrates why such incidents happen, how these incidents can be prevented, how those people who are tempted to give up their life can be made to think about the importance of life. Kevin Briggs saved life of more than 200 suicidal subjects. It’d be great to hear from him:</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p class="MsoNormal"><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">We live in a world where life is ornamented by emotions, actions, happiness, depression etc. Incidents like Sadness, depression etc are inevitable just like happiness. They are a part of life. We accidently destroyed our society system of living in this Era of social Media. We’re becoming captive of our own thoughts. We are very less affected by situation of others. But enough is enough. We need to return to our societal system. People need to be listened. People need to be understood. There are a lot of arguments in our daily life. While arguing we must consider, what to argue about and how much to argue. Most importantly we must know How to argue.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Everyone suffer in their life, but we can choose “What to suffer for?” Either we can suffer due to tiny problems of our life or we can head on to better ones, choice is ours. Many of the problems arise due to hearing improperly. I mean, a situation where we hear but still we don’t hear. We can never solve such issues. Everyone has a mouth full of words to tell and to give advice about. But let’s keep our discussion short. Suppose one of Your Friend is depressed. What would you say? Would you know what to say? In my experience, it’s not just the talking that you do, but the listening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Listen to understand. By just being there, we may just be the turning pointy that they need.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Mr.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Briggs, in one of his conference shared his experience and told about a guy named Kevin Berthia;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="background-color: #cfe2f3;">On March 11 of 2005, I responded to a radio call of a possible suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk. I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk and observed Kevin Berthia standing on sidewalk.&nbsp; When he saw me, he immediately traversed the pedestrian rail, and stood on a small pipe which goes around the tower. For the next hour and a half, I listened as Kevin spoke about his depression and hopelessness. Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance. When Kevin came back over, I congratulated him. “This is a new beginning, a new life”. But I asked him, “What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance?” And you know what he told me? He&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #cfe2f3;">said, “You listened. You let me speak, and you just listened.”&nbsp; Today Kevin Berthia is a good member of the society and helping others by his experience</span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">We need a lot of skills to have a better world. We have to start somewhere. I say, Let’s start with a good heart and two ears. Let’s Listen. Let’s listen to understand. Let’s observe (listen to) the world because our loved ones really need to be listened and ultimately understood.</p><p class="MsoNormal">POWER TO YOU!</p>
