            <h2>PI Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <p>Pi is a new digital cryptocurrency  being developed by a group of Stanford PhD's. 
               This cryptocurrency is in it's pre-release stage and the company is allowing users
               to mine this cryptocurrency on their devices. More than 10 million users are mining
               Pi crypto using their phones.
            </p>    
              
            <h3>Why Pi?</h3>
            <p>Analysts believe that Pi is going to be the next Bitcoin and it's value may rise upto
               $200 by 2022. Just like other digital currencies, Pi will have some value against fiat
               currerncies like USD,EURO, INR etc, allowing it's users to trade it on exchanges and 
               pay using it wherever it will be accepted.
            </p> 
            
            <h3>How do Company benefit from our mining?</h3>
            </p>Company is growing it's userbase before launch. Larger the number of users, more will
                be the capital and demand of the cryptocurrency and hence more will be the value of Pi.
                It is very safe to mine and make some fortune with them.
            </p>    

            <h3>How much Pi Worth?</h3>
            </p>Right now value of Pi is not determined so it's Zero. Once it reaches the mandate, it's
                value will be determined as per it's market capital and some other factors like it's 
                demand etc. Mandate is the stage when a cryptocurrency is registered on exchanges so that
                people can trade using it.
            </p>    

            <h3>Is Pi worth mining?</h3>
            <p>I would say, Yes. You're mining a cryptocurrency. Yes, I said cryptocurrency. The only
               factor which we should care about is more and more value of pi. As the value of Pi will
               increase, so will your earning. So it is a both side benefit. Start mining it fellas.
            </p>
           <p>GOOD LUCK.</p>
